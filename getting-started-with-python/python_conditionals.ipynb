        "## Introduction\n",
        "Conditional statements are an essential part of programming. They allow you to control the flow of information based on certain conditions. In Python, `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements are used to implement conditional logic.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Using conditional statements to branch program execution is a core part of coding for most data professionals, so itâ€™s important to understand how they work.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Conditional Syntax\n",
        "Python provides built-in comparison and logical operators that help evaluate conditions in `if-elif-else` blocks. The basic syntax is:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if condition1:\n",
        "    # block of code to execute if condition1 evaluates to True\n",
        "\n",
        "elif condition2:\n",
        "    # block of code to execute if condition1 is False\n",
        "    # and condition2 evaluates to True\n",
        "\n",

        "    # block of code to execute if BOTH condition1 and condition2 evaluate to False"
