        "# Function Syntax in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "### Defining Functions\n",
        "To define functions in Python, follow this syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Begin with the `def` keyword** followed by the function name and parentheses containing its parameters/arguments, ending with a colon.  \n",
        "   - Use snake_case (lowercase words separated by underscores) for function names.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Include a docstring for important functions** or those whose purpose isnâ€™t obvious.  \n",
        "   - The docstring should be written between triple quotes (`\"\"\"`).\n",
        "   - Write it as a command (e.g., \"Add two numbers\" instead of \"Adds two numbers\").\n",
        "   - Summarize the function's behavior and explain its arguments and return values.\n",
        "   - Indent the docstring four spaces from the `def` line.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Write the body of the function.**  \n",
        "   - Code should be indented at least four spaces from the `def` statement, and there may be more indentation based on complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Use a return statement or print statement.**  \n",
        "   - The `return` statement provides a result that can be used elsewhere, whereas the `print` statement outputs something to the console.  \n",
        "   - Indent this line by four spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `return` vs. `print`\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **`return` statement** gives you a result that can be used later. It's like your brother going to the market and bringing you potatoes.\n",
        "- A **`print` statement** just shows information on the console. It's like your brother telling you what potatoes were available but not bringing any back.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Functions vs. Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Functions**: Standalone blocks of code that don't belong to any class.\n",
        "- **Methods**: A type of function that belongs to a class and can be used via dot notation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of a Method\n",
        "```python\n",
        "my_string = \"The eagles filled the sky.\"\n",
        "my_string.split()\n"
