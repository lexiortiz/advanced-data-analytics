        "Python is a flexible programming language used in a wide range of fields, including software development, machine learning, and data analysis. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data professionals, so getting familiar with its fundamental syntax and semantics will be useful for your future career. In this reading, you will learn about Python’s syntax and semantics, as well as where to find resources to further your learning.\n",

        "## The Language of Python\n",
        "People use language to communicate and give instructions to each other. Computers do the same thing, except computers use languages like Python, C++, and Java. So, in order to communicate instructions to the computer, programmers need to arrange ideas and concepts into a language it will understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python syntax includes words that represent objects and commands, as well as punctuation that gives the words structure, hierarchy, and context. Together, the words and punctuation communicate ideas and processes; this is known as semantics. Semantics is the meaning conveyed by the syntax. The best way to learn syntax and semantics is through exposure. Practice coding and become familiar and comfortable with reading other people’s code. In addition, there are some general conventions that practitioners use to help maintain stylistic uniformity within the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Coding languages are similar to spoken languages in that they have a way to classify words according to their function. For example, English sentences are composed of nouns, verbs, prepositions, etc.\n",

It may feel excessive when you write it, but when you return to your code you’ll find it much easier to understand."
